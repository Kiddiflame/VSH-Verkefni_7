        <p><span class="FirstWords">Dark Souls</span> 
        is a third-person action role-playing game. The core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternate areas to explore. Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous open world environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). Players are able to travel to and from areas and explore various paths, although certain prerequisites have to be met in order to unlock certain areas. Scattered throughout the game world are bosses and creatures of varying types that must be defeated. From almost all enemies killed, the player will receive a relative amount of "souls" which act as both currency and experience points. Some enemies also yield rare items.
        <br><br>
        Central to Dark Souls are Bonfires. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and can be teleported to, and, when rested at, heal the player and save their progression upon death. While resting, players can level up and repair their equipment, among other things. However, resting also causes all of the previously defeated enemies of an area to come back to life and return to their original map placements, except for bosses and mini-bosses.
        <br><br>
        Another aspect of Dark Souls is the <span class="FirstWords">“humanity”</span> system. There are two states of being in the game. While in “human” form, the character will appear human with healthy skin. Being human opens the online portion of the game, allowing allies to be summoned; and invading/being invaded by other players, as well as boosting certain resistances. However, when a human player becomes undead, they will enter “hollow” form with an undead appearance. The hollow form is a progressive condition; increasing hollow brings loss of sanity and health, although the details are unclear and definitely differ among story characters. To return to human status, a player must spend one humanity point at a Bonfire. In a prophetic twist, the Darksign, a mark of the undead, also recreates the player's body at a bonfire to re-enter the game after dying.
        <br><br>
        <span class="FirstWords">Humanity</span> can be acquired in a large variety of ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form. Death in either form results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their "bloodstain", the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.
        <br><br>
        Although being in human form is a prerequisite for much of the online play, there are still certain functions that occur no matter what state a player’s character is in, so long as the game is connected to the Internet. Players can view the deaths of other players in the area through bloodstains on the ground, which can reveal traps or hidden enemies. Players can also see the shades of other players who are in the same area and what they are doing.
        <br><br>
        Communication between players is deliberately limited. If the player is in "party chat" on the Xbox 360, the game will set itself to offline mode. On the other hand, private chat between two players at a time is allowed. Other than character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of Orange Soapstones, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area, as well as several Archtree Carvings, introduced in the DLC, which say pre-recorded phrases that other players can hear during co-op and player vs. player interactions. Some areas of the game have been designated unofficial player vs. player hotspots by the community, and invaders in these areas often engage in duels.
